xcoare: COARE bulk flux algorithms for xarray objects
-----------------------------------------------------

This is an alpha quality port of the bulk flux algorithms at ftp://ftp1.esrl.noaa.gov/BLO/Air-Sea/bulkalg/.

Currently COARE3.5 is available and passes tests (!) with output from the MATLAB version.
